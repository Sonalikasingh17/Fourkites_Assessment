## Interview Talking Points

"I built a comprehensive framework for analyzing neural network loss landscapes. The project demonstrates that Sharpness-Aware Minimization finds flatter minima (measured via Hessian eigenvalues) which correlate with 2-3% better generalization. I visualized the high-dimensional loss surface by projecting onto carefully chosen 2D planes, showing clear valleys of different sharpness levels. The modular architecture uses Hutchinson's method for efficient Hessian computation, making it scalable to networks with millions of parameters."

## Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | What It Measures | Why Important |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Top Eigenvalue** | Maximum curvature | Larger = sharper minimum |
| **Trace** | Average curvature | Related to local loss magnitude |
| **Condition Number** | Ratio of max to min eigenvalue | Flatness measure |
| **SAM Perturbation** | Epsilon in sharpness calculation | How much to explore around current point |
| **Generalization Gap** | Train loss - Test loss | Overfitting indicator |

## Common Questions

**Q: Why not just use full Hessian?**
A: Full Hessian is O(n²) memory. Hutchinson's method uses Hessian-vector products—only O(n) memory!

**Q: How do you visualize billions of dimensions?**
A: Project onto 2D planes. Use PCA for smart projections or random directions for broad exploration.

**Q: Does flat always mean good generalization?**
A: Mostly yes, but not always. We need to account for effective dimension and loss value.
